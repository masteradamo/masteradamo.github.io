  This is my online portal.

My name is Stephen McGregor, and this is my website.  I hope to soon begin populating this space with topical reflections on the various things that interest me, which means language, technology, philosophy, politics, and really almost anything else.  For the time being, I'm somewhat preoccupied with my academic work (see below).

### About Me

I'm currently working as a post-doctoral researcher on a [project](http://www.chistera.eu/projects/atlantis) investigating grounded language learning with an eye towards robotic applications, based in [Laborattoire Lattice](http://lattice.cnrs.fr/?lang=fr) at the École normale supérieure in Paris.  This is in many ways a natural extension of my PhD work, whcih explored ways to capture with computational models the unbounded semantic and corresponding cognitive flexibility inherent in the way humans use language.

For a fairly up-to-date list of my academic publications, including, in most cases, links to pdfs, please go [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Mcgregor).

I've also written a good bit of code in the course of my research, particularly relating to statistical semantic spaces and computer generated poetry.  Some of this code can be found on my [github page](https://github.com/masteradamo?tab=repositories).
