This is the homepage for me (Stephen McGregor) to share some of my ideas and opinions online.  I hope to soon populate this space with interesting, witty, and topical reflections on issues in areas such as politics, linguistics, philosophy, and technology.

For my academic home page, please go [here](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/view/35826/stephen-mcgregor).

For a list of my academic publications, including, in most cases, links to pdfs, please go [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Mcgregor).

Some day soon I'd like to sit down and get this code cleaned up enough to publicly distribute.  For the time being, I'm very happy to release my code to individuals upon request, as long as you understand that it's really a mess.
